# Third-Party-API

## Description 

This is a project that mainly involves Javascript but a little bit of HTML. In this assignment, there was already starter code given to us and our job is to fix it, or to add functionality that wasn't already there. This is mainly accomplished through the Javascript file, and there were many things that needed to be added in order for this to work properly. For the first part, in order for the page to look good in the beginning, you can add a big time block in the front to show what time it is. On top of that, other functions can also be added loops can be added in order to add the function of saving things in local directory. The HTML page that was already written in this assignment is already a really good page. It has everything divided into sections. The CSS page in this was also really well written, with the classes displaying different colors.

## Installation

First, by cloning the repository down to your computer, you can copy down the existing index.html file. Next, open it up with GitBash and type in "code ." , which should open up VSCode. From there, there were a lot of errors and things that needed to be fixed, which will be went over in the next section.

## Usage 

Looking at the top of the page, you can see that you are immediately greeted with a big "Work Day Scheduler" heading, which is really big size and easy for the user to read. Looking below that, you can see that there's a description and displays the time. This is possible using the Day Js application, an alternative to Javascript. This is built on top of Javascript to make things easier.

Second, by scrolling down to the bottom of the page, you can see that there is an area for you to write text in. On top of that, there is a button on the right of that with the save icon, indicating that you can save things on there. Once you press save, it will save on the page. After a refresh, you can see that it also still saves on the page. This is because of the local storage saving that occurs.

Furthermore, if you were to notice carefully on the page, you can see that it is color coded.

## Credits

Special shoutout to TA Kyle Vance for assisting me with this project. He helped me learn the structure in which files should be presented in Github, as well as figure out some things about how variables and things work in Javascript.
